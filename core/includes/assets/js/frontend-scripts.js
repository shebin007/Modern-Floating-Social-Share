/*------------------------- 
Frontend related javascript
-------------------------*/

/**
 * HELPER COMMENT START
 * 
 * This file contains all of the frontend related javascript. 
 * With frontend, it is meant the WordPress site that is visible for every visitor.
 * 
 * Since you added the jQuery dependency within the "Add JS support" module, you see down below
 * the helper comment a function that allows you to use jQuery with the commonly known notation: $('')
 * By default, this notation is deactivated since WordPress uses the noConflict mode of jQuery
 * You can also use jQuery outside using the following notation: jQuery('')
 * 
 * Here's some jQuery example code you can use to fire code once the page is loaded: $(document).ready( function(){} );
 * 
 * Using the ajax example, you can send data back and forth between your frontend and the 
 * backend of the website (PHP to ajax and vice-versa). 
 * As seen in the example below, we use the jQuery $.ajax function to send data to the WordPress
 * callback my_demo_ajax_call, which was added within the Modern_Floating_Social_Share_Run class.
 * From there, we process the data and send it back to the code below, which will then display the 
 * example within the console of your browser.
 * 
 * You can add the localized variables in here as followed: modernfloa.plugin_name
 * These variables are defined within the localization function in the following file:
 * core/includes/classes/class-modern-floating-social-share-run.php
 * 
 * HELPER COMMENT END
